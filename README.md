# Cypress Automation Testing Project - DemoQA

This repository showcases a structured Cypress test automation framework built for testing the DemoQA website.
It includes automated tests for UI components in the Elements section using best practices such as:

- Page Object Model (POM),
- Test data via fixtures,
- MochaAwesome HTML reporting,
- File upload/download support.

# Recruiter Note

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Create maintainable and scalable Cypress test frameworks
- Apply good practices like POM and test data management
- Integrate with CI-ready tools like Mochawesome

It is an example of how I write tests in a real-world scenario, aiming for clarity, separation of concerns, and reliability.
